## Understanding Agricultural Coastal Plain Soils: Pedon Mapping and Taxonomic Insights

This research project is focused on characterizing and classifying agricultural soils in Georgia’s Coastal Plain, a region that has been historically underrepresented in soil taxonomic studies and digital soil mapping. The work integrates detailed field-based pedon descriptions with laboratory analyses to explore spatial and taxonomic variability across the landscape. Pedons are evaluated using both supervised taxonomic classification and unsupervised clustering of soil properties to assess whether data-driven approaches can support or refine traditional soil taxonomy. Together, these components provide insight into soil profile development, landscape controls, and the potential for predictive and exploratory pedometric approaches in Coastal Plain soils.


The link below contains an interactive map of soil pedons, allowing users to explore individual soil profiles in their spatial context.
